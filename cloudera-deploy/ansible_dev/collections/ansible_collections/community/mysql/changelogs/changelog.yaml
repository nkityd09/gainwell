  3.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Collection core functions - use vendored version of ``distutils.version``
        instead of the deprecated Python standard library ``distutils`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/269).
      minor_changes:
      - Added explicit description of the supported versions of databases and connectors.
        Changes to the collection are **NOT** tested against database versions older
        than `mysql 5.7.31` and `mariadb 10.2.37` or connector versions older than
        `pymysql 0.7.10` and `mysqlclient 2.0.1`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/discussions/141)
      - mysql_user - added the ``force_context`` boolean option to set the default
        database context for the queries to be the ``mysql`` database. This way replication/binlog
        filters can catch the statements (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/265).
